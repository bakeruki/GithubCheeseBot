# GithubCheeseBot
The GithubCheese Bot was created to compete in the BattleBot arena program.

# Strategy
The GithubCheese bot follows a strategy that involves an action that we call cycling. The bot chooses a safe and close edge and moves across that edge.
While moving across the edge, it will randomly fire in the opposite direction of the edge. In other words, it will fire towards the empty space that is
away from the edge. The bot is also capable of firing at nearby bots and dodging bullets (to an extent)
